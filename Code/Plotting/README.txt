CURRENT STATUS: SAMPLE FIGURES

This file contains updated information of the available type of sample figures, given data inputs and specifications per run in STEVFNs


Updated as of 28 November 2022:
Info on files and folders:
sampleFig_costAssets.png and
sampleFig_sizeAssets.png are samples from first runs, can be deleted. Figures of this style will be gathered in separate folders per case study: Autarky, X-links, X-links_Extended

sampleCosts_byCaseStudy.png is first figure with the suggested style from the outline suggested as Figure 4: Results Example

Folders:
X-links Case Studies - Includes sample figures for X-links style case studies (2 locations, currently ran for GB-SP and GB-MA). Can explore a GB-ZA as well without the stopover in MA which is the X-links_Extended case study

General information on model:

1. Same costs (PV, wind, BESS, HVDC) used for all case studies ran and impacting results
2. Demand profiles updated for 2019 in GB, SP, and ZA:
(a) GB - uses hourly demand from National Grid public data calculated as National Demand (all metered generation, half-hourly and resampled with maximum demand hourly)
(b) SP - uses Iberian Peninsula demand data 
(c) ZA - Hourly data provided by ESKOM. National demand estimated through all contracted demand with ESKOM
(d) MA - currently uses SP demand data in first runs due to lack of real data. Needs updating

Next steps being implemented:
1. Updating demand profile for MA
2. Development of an UnmetDemand asset to observe effect on costs as a 2% tolerance is introduced for not meeting demand
3. Updating costs. Where available, specific installation costs per location, added options for cost sensitivity analysis
